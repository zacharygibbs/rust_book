[Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) exercises - inspired by "The Rust Programming Language" online book exercises.

I have been interested in learning Rust, and have decided to take the plunge. I have heard good things about this book, and it's no doubt that Rust can be a tough language - so I'm going through these exercises to learn how to code Idiomatic Rust - learning the right way to do things so that I won't have to fight the borrow checker as much!

Wish me luck :).
